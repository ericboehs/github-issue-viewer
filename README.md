### Git Hooks Installation

This project includes git hooks to ensure code quality and automate common tasks:

```

#### Available Hooks

- **pre-commit**: Runs for all commits
  - Checks EditorConfig compliance (if `editorconfig-checker` is installed)
  - Executes `bin/rubocop` to check code style (if available)
  - Runs `bin/rails test` to ensure tests pass (if available)
  - Provides helpful installation messages for missing tools
  - Prevents commit if any enabled check fails

- **post-checkout**: Runs automatically when switching branches
  - Runs `bundle install` if Gemfile.lock changed
  - Runs `bin/rails db:migrate` if there are pending migrations
  - Skips during merge/rebase operations and detached HEAD state

### EditorConfig

This project uses [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) to maintain consistent coding styles. Make sure your editor supports EditorConfig, or install the appropriate plugin.

For command-line validation, install the EditorConfig checker:
```bash
npm install -g editorconfig-checker
```

## Development

### Running tests
```bash
bin/rails test
```

### Code quality checks
```bash
bin/rubocop        # Check Ruby style
bin/brakeman       # Security analysis
```

### CI Monitoring
```bash
bin/watch-ci       # Watch CI status with auto-refresh (default: 10s)
bin/watch-ci 5     # Custom refresh interval (5 seconds)
```
